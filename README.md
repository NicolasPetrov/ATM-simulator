This code provides the basic functionality for an ATM interface with login functionality, balance checking, viewing transactions, depositing, and withdrawing money. The program uses Java Swing for the graphical interface. To develop this application, I needed to know basic Java syntax and data types, understand basic arithmetic operations, work with the user on data input/output, implement logic to determine the winner and JavaFx.
